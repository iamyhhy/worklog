1. fMRI project preparation
    a. all the ICSE paper info is in the svn repo:
    church.cs.virginia.edu
    username: yu
    
    b. check the ICSE paper for more details of:
        i. the magic keyboard that can be used in a fmri machine
        ii. useful citations 

    c. think about how to enable "writing code" in this experiment. This
    can be a starter paper from this project.

    d. "Provenance" study
        i. what stimuli? In the ICSE paper, it used code from github and
      english phrase from SAT books. In this new study, do you want to
      use IDE? Which IDE? Limitation: small screen, no mouse, touch
      typing.
        ii. What are the categories for "who the code is written by"?
        Trusted Colleague, An suspacious spy country? 
        iii. Do we say anything on the screen to the
        paticipants?e.g."This code is written by XXX"
        iv. What questions do we ask in the experiment? e.g. "Would you
        accept this code?" But we do want to ask more questions to
        maximize knowledge we can learn from the experiment.

     e. How IRB works here?

    #########TASK TO DO:##########

    a. Check out how IRB works. Do you need to do any online training
    like CITI? Can you transfer it from UVa? Can you transfer an IRB
    protocol from UVa? Or at least can you use an old IRB protocol from
    UVa as a reference to shorten the IRB process in UMich?

    b. Ask tyler for course slides for doing the math of fMri data

    c. Find collaborators in Medicine, then email Wes.

    d. Get Med school IDs
    
    e. Chase down citations in psychology about medical imaging, brain
    usage for different tasks and different cognition of others. (people
    use different part of brain if they are informed someone else is
    gonna cheat on him/her)

    f. Buy a keyboard---maybe we already have one. Is it the one cited
    in the ICSE paper?






2. Quadcopter project
    ######## TASK TO DO:########
    Make the tracign work for a linked list.
    linked list *l
    read in a buch of numbers and insert in the link list
    reverse it
    print it

    Can you trace the map form the global space to the heap of this
    linked list? So next time you resume the code, you can make it
    follow tha right map or anyway get the right data in the linked
    list?

    There are two methods that can work:
    a. low-level binary operation
    "Boenm-Wiser GC"
    When a segment fault happens, do not let the OS kill your program,
    instead, call some other function then resume the program.

    cons: do not need to change the source code.

    b. rewrite source code
    list *tmp
    for {tmp=l 
    tmp!=null
    tmp= tmp-> next}
    save tmp-> data
    then print "data" out and save it somewhere

    cons: you can write code to write code. E.g. CIL
    pros: you have to control variables: what variables do you want to
    do this to?


3. Project 3: Pick up something you are interested in from other
faculties' group. Find 2 or 3 candidates and email Wes.
